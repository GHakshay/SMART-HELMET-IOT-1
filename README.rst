SMART-HELMET-IOT is a IOT based smart helmet which was developed by team CODE SPEAR for an all INDIA level competition
and ended up scoring 10 rank.

SMART-HELMET-IOT ensures that the rider wear the helmet properly and make sure that motor vehicle won't function
until rider wear helmet. It directly integrate with the motor vehicle system which ensure that no one can mishandle it.

SMART-HELMET-IOT is developed in such a way that it can be easily integrated with all the current operating vehicles and helmet,
so there is no need to buy a totally new helmet or a new vehicle.

SMART-HELMET-IOT is also feasible and will cost less than 300 rupees for the whole model.
